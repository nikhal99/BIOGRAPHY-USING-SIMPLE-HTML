    <H2> BIOGRAPHY</H2>
    <p>Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is the fictional antihero protagonist of the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston.

        Walter was a skilled chemist and co-founder of a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners. While his partners became billionaires, Walter became a frustrated high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, barely making ends meet with his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walter is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walter resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to his expertise, Walter's "blue meth" is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade.
        
        Walter becomes increasingly ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walter struggles with managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law and DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). Walter becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface". Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in The X-Files episode "Drive", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walter's backstory, personality, and physical appearance.When Walter White was six years old, his father died of Huntington's disease. He studied chemistry at California Institute of Technology and, after graduate school, worked as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratory. There he conducted research on proton radiography that helped a team win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985.[14][15] Using some of the prize money, Walter then founded the firm Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott Schwartz (Adam Godley), his former classmate and close friend.[16] Around this time, Walter dated his lab assistant, Gretchen Schwartz (Jessica Hecht). He left both Gretchen and Gray Matter Technologies, selling his financial interest in the company for $5,000.[15][17] Gretchen and Elliott later married and made a fortune, much of it from Walter's research.[17][18] Though they remain friendly, Walter secretly resents both Gretchen and Elliott for profiting from his work.[18][19]

        At the age of 50, Walter works as a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, providing instruction to uninterested and disrespectful students.[14][20] Walter also has another job at a local car wash to supplement his income, which proves to be particularly humiliating when he has to clean the cars of his own students.[21] Walter and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) have a teenage son named Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has cerebral palsy. Skyler is also pregnant with their second child, Holly, who is born at the end of season two.[22] Walter's other family includes Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt); her husband, Hank (Dean Norris), who is a DEA agent; and his mother, who is never seen.[23]

He studied chemistry at California Institute of Technology and, after graduate school, worked as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratory. There he conducted research on proton radiography that helped a team win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985.[14][15] Using some of the prize money, Walter then founded the firm Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott Schwartz (Adam Godley), his former classmate and close friend.[16] Around this time, Walter dated his lab assistant, Gretchen Schwartz (Jessica Hecht). He left both Gretchen and Gray Matter Technologies, selling his financial interest in the company for $5,000.[15][17] Gretchen and Elliott later married and made a fortune, much of it from Walter's research.[17][18] Though they remain friendly, Walter secretly resents both Gretchen and Elliott for profiting from his work.[18][19]

        At the age of 50, Walter works as a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, providing instruction to uninterested and disrespectful students.[14][20] Walter also has another job at a local car wash to supplement his income, which proves to be particularly humiliating when he has to clean the cars of his own students.[21] Walter and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) have a teenage son named Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has cerebral palsy. Skyler is also pregnant with their second child, Holly, who is born at the end of season two.[22] Walter's other family includes Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt); her husband, Hank (Dean Norris), who is a DEA agent; and his mother, who is never seen.[23]
